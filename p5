Implementing the round robin schedule
-------------------------------------

You need to program the Round Robin scheduling algorithm reading data from file.

The program will read from a file containing a list of processes with pertinent data for the process and will simulate the execution ofthe processes. 

It will print out the time taken by each process to complete and the wait time.

•Inputs : A filename from the keyboard, read the file for the pertinent data, and a possible time slice size (provided by the user). 

	The input file will look like this :

				Process   Arrival Time	Burst Time
				
				 P1           0           20.0 
				
				 P2           2           15.0 
				
				 P3           4           27.0 
				
				 P4           6           36.0 
				 
				 
				 
•Output :  

A prompt for which file is to be read. A prompt for the amount of time for a time-slice.

A list of each process and the time it took for it to complete. 


Example:
The name of the file to be read: <filename >

Output 

			process name 		completion time 	wait time


				? 						? 				?
